# unoffical-openlara-oculus-quest2-airlink-test
Almost 100% of the code comes from the amazing project: https://github.com/XProger/OpenLara

This unofficial project is some very subtle mods to openlara code to make it more palatable to use with oculus quest 2 hardware using air link utility.
I just want to add a few twiddly bits to make it work a bit more nicely on the quest 2 in airlink
